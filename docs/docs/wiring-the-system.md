## Camera

Attach the camera to the Pi with a flat ribbon cable. The cable should have blue tabs on one side of each end.

The blue tab goes towards the ethernet port on the Pi and towards the back of the camera (away from the lens).

## Lights

You want to use an external 12V AC/DC power supply. Never connect this directly to the Pi, instead use a relay switch.

- Wire 2x GPIO pins to a two-channel relay
- Connect the lights to the two-channel relay

## Optional
- Wire the DHT temperature sensor (optional)
- Wire a IR light sensor
- Wire a visible light sensor
