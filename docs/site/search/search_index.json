If your directly connect an LED to power and ground without a resistor you will burn the LED. All LEDs need a resistor wired in parallel, these are called 'current limiting resistor'.\n\n\nUse IR LEDs \n900 nm.\n - These are within the sensitivity range of the Pi NoIR camera.

The 'hot' end wire usually has a white line down the length of the wire. You can also determine the 'hot' end using a multi-meter, it is the one that gives a positive (not negative) voltage when attached to the positive (normally red) end of the multi-meter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut a bit of wire and connect the center 'common pin' of channel 1 to the center 'common pin' of channel 2.

Stick the positive end into the 'normally closed' port of channel 2 on the relay switch. Attach the negative end of the IR LED to the 'ground' wire of the 12V AC/DC adapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important concept is that 'all grounds are the same'.

Yet, for this simple system to work, a number of independent components must each work and must communicate with each other. As is often the case, the implementation details to create a simple system is complex. Two cliches to describe this is 'you can't fly with half a wing' and 'the devil is in the details'.\n\n\nWe have about 15 components in use! Each component is developed independently and all are open source. It is amazing that this system works? What follows is a description of the different pieces of the homecage system with links to the source code and the components that are used.\n\n\nRaspberry Pi system\n\n\nDon't forget the Raspberry Pi!

Also has function to talk to \nhomecage_app.py\n web server via a \nREST\n interface.

This includes controlling DIO pins to turn lights on/off, running \nbash\n scripts to start/stop the video and to convert .h264 video files to .mp4. This code provides a clearly defined application programming interface (API) to all these components such that the web server in \nhomecage_app.py\n has an easier job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhomecage_app.py\n - Python code that uses the \nFlask\n library to run the web-server and provide bi-directional control of the \nhome.py\n back-end. In one direction, it accepts web url requests and sends them to the backend, in the other direction, it accesses the back-end and send information back out to the web clients.
